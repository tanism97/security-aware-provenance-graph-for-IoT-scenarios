# security-aware-provenance-graph-for-IoT-scenarios
In this minor research project, we explore the new struture of provenance graphs and let basic PROV-DM model obtain security-aware featrue. 

We leverage security-aware provenance graphs to develope a function named security-aware to provide more comprehensive IoT system transpreancy to IoT end-users.

In our project, the hypothetical IoT scenario is an IoT-health scenario.

We prove its feasibility via an implementation.
